As a consultant, the vast majority of my work belongs to clients. As a boomer, the remaining IP can be seen on my [blog](https://theitsolutionist.com/). I only recently began maintaining this page and it will probably be awhile before time, priorities and inclination combine for more.

Meanwhile, sharing this: https://github.com/ssnsolutionist/ssnsolutionist/blob/main/sfdx-cli-common-commands.md
